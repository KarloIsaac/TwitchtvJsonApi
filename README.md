# TwitchtvJsonApi

This is a toy project that forms part of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) program to get acquainted with web technologies.

The aim of this Project is to use the information (JSON format) retrieved by the Twitchtv API. 

The user of this code should be able to:

* User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
* User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
* User Story: if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
